Cyber Security Operations Centres (SOC) endeavour to detect and respond to cyber-attacks in near real-time with a centralised and structured approach. Using the concept of people, processes, and technologies, mature SOCs provide capabilities such as threat monitoring, forensic investigation, incident management and security reporting.

The SOC is the only viable solution for large organisations to combat Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and other sophisticated cyber-attack actors. Therefore, the deployment of enterprise security operations functions are increasing for both internal IT teams and as managed services. However, several issues surrounding an approved framework, architecture models and incident identification workflows are slowing the progress of cyber defence.

The accepted commercial SOC frameworks are business-risk and vendor product driven, adapting solutions from vendor and industry certification alignment. On the contrary, as a crime and technology issue, SOC framework development could benefit from an adherence to enterprise architecture frameworks, defence frameworks, system and software engineering concepts and even combat system architectures.

Research in discovering the optimal SOC architectural framework is minimal. Attention is given to vendor technology capability (Systems rather than subsystems) without an overall system of systems view that has the ability to detect and respond to advanced threats holistically across a network. Conceptual and design research therefore has been commissioned by OWASP to develop a mission-orientated SOC framework with accompanying architectural models to show the variance or the agreed upon types of operations environments.

Discovering the optimal SOC operations architecture could lead to new technology developments and security functions that enhance the overall detection rate of sophisticated attacks, whilst reducing the human interaction and minimising false positives through automated elements.
